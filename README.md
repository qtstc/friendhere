FriendHere
==========
FriendHere is a event-based social discovery platform.

It often happens that you know your friend attends the same event as you do, but you have no idea where they are.
There are a few steps that you probably will need to take to meet your friend:
1. Search for their number in your phone. If you find it, go to the next step
2. Call them and wait for them to answer your call. If your friend picks up the phone, go to the next step
3. Describe to them your location. If both of you are familiar with the place, go to the next step
4. Stand still and pray that they will be able to find you based on the information you give. If that happends, go to the next step
5. Meet and talk!
If any of the steps goes wrong, you would put your phone back into your pocket disappointedly and wish you will have some luck and see your friend in the crowd.

With Friendher, all these steps will be unnecessary.
All you need to do is tell the app that you will be at the event, then you will be able to search among the people who are also attending and get their location.
